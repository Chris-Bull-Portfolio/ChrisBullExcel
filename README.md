This is work I completed using Excel in my Data Analysis Skills Bootcamp.

## Project 1 - Basic Functions and Conditional Formatting
This project used the Retail_Sales dataset: [Retail_Sales.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18944382/Retail_Sales.xlsx)
In this project, I did the following:
* Filtered and sorted to show the best students in each subject
* Calculated the average for all students in column E
* Used the MAX fucntion to show what each student's highest score was in column F
* Filtered and sorted to show the best student in the class by average
* Filtered and sorted to show the best student in the class by highest score
* Used conditional formatting to clearly identify the highest and lowest average scores

The final result of these functions can be seen below:

## Project 2 - Exanding into XLOOKUP and Drop-down Menus
This is a continuation of the previous project using the Retail_Sales dataset making my own changes through creativity and experimentation.
In this project, I made the following additions:
* Added an if statement to say whether each student had ‘passed’ or not if their average score was above 75
* Added a countif to count up how many of the subjects each student were below the 75 pass mark
* Added an ifs statement to say how whether each student had passed overall or how many subjects they were not passing
* Added averages for each subject for the whole class
* Added a sum to show the total number of subjects not being passed by all students collectively
* Added a drop down menu to select each individual student
* Added xlookups that would pull each students score in each subject and their average score
* Added conditional formatting so this average score would turn green if they were above the 75 pass mark or red if they were below it

The final result of these changes can be seen in the following two screenshots:

## Project 3 - Pivot Tables
This project used the Bike_Sales dataset: [Bike_Sales.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18944877/Bike_Sales.xlsx)
In this project, I did the following:
* Created a pivot table based on Age Group, Gender and Country to show each group's total Order Quantity
* Used the pivot table to create a stacked bar chart to visualise which Age Group and Gender had the highest Order Quantity in each Country

The final result of this can be seen below:

## Project 4 - Visualisations
This project used the Bike_Sales_Visualisations dataset: [Bike_Sales_Visualisations.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18945544/Bike_Sales_Visualisations.xlsx)
In this project, I did the following:
* Created a line graph to show Revenue vs Profits
* Created a stacked bar chart to show Product Revenue by Country
* Created a Pie Chart to show Revenue by Age Group

These graphs can be seen below:
